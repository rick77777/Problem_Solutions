Error: open jenkins/values.yaml: no such file or directory
was the error we faced
It pointed out that there was no such file or directory as jenkins/values.yaml

We have a directory structure like - 

              continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes
                              ||
                 =============================
                ||                           ||
            linux-amd64                   jenkins
                ||                           ||  
               helm                      values.yaml
         
Now we are executing the command from within the linux-amd64 directory - 
./helm install -n cd stable/jenkins -f jenkins/values.yaml --version 0.16.6 --wait

So it could not find the file as it only looks in the subdirectories and the current directory,
whereas, jenkins/values.yaml is in another branch of their parent directory.

To solve the error - 
1) copy the helm file into jenkins directory
    
    $ cp linux-amd64/helm jenkins
   This command does the 'copying' trick
   
2) then replace the command given in the tutorial
    
    $ ./helm install -n cd stable/jenkins -f jenkins/values.yaml --version 0.16.6 --wait
    
    with $ ./helm install -n cd stable/jenkins -f values.yaml --version 0.16.6 --wait
   
   This would create the new directory and then the rest of the steps are as in the tutorial

Hope this helps...
Cheers!!!
